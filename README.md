# 🌾 Project Samarth — AI Assistant for Agriculture Insights
🧠 Overview

Project Samarth is an AI-powered agriculture assistant built to support farmers, researchers, and policymakers by providing intelligent insights about rainfall, climate, crop patterns, and agricultural trends.
It uses Large Language Models (via g4f) to generate meaningful and contextual answers without needing any paid OpenAI key — making advanced AI accessible and open for everyone.

🎯 Key Features

✅ Rainfall Prediction Assistance – Get intelligent explanations of rainfall trends and seasonal forecasts.
✅ Agriculture Insights – Understand how rainfall, soil, and weather patterns impact crop productivity.
✅ Interactive Q&A Interface – Ask any agriculture-related question and receive real-time, AI-driven responses.
✅ Free & Open-Source AI – Powered by g4f, an open-source alternative to OpenAI API, so no API key is required.
✅ Streamlit Web App – Simple, modern UI that works directly in your browser.

💡 Example Queries

You can ask:

“Predict rainfall trend in Maharashtra for next season.”

“How will irregular monsoons affect crop yields in India?”

“Explain how climate change impacts paddy cultivation.”

“Suggest irrigation strategies during low rainfall periods.”
